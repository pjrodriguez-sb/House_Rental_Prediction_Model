# Springboard-Airbnb Booking price prediction model

I worked on a Regression problem to predict Airbnb booking prices using data I got from the Airbnb website. First, I designed several baseline models like Random Forest, lineal regressor, Gradient boost, extreme gradient boost models. Then, I evaluated their performance using r squared and root mean square error to measure the differences between the predicted values and the actual values.
